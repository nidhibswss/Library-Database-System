# Library-Database-System - BiblioTech📕📚

In this DBMS project, we learned how to:
1. Design a relational database management system (RDBMS)
2. Make an ER diagram of our DBMS
3. Define data types, structures, and constraints of the data in our database
4. Create and manage our database using DDL and DML statements (inserting,
modifying, deleting data)
5. Create views for our database
6. Execute our queries at UNIX shell menu commands
7. Show functional dependencies
8. Normalize the database in 1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF
9. Ensure data efficiency by making sure there is no redundant data other than absolutely
necessary
10. Perform data manipulation by querying the database using SQL to retrieve specific
data
11. Create a web based GUI for our database using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and
Flask.
